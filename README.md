# Tic Tac Toe

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript)

This is a tic tac toe game that was created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game features one player and two player modes. In the one player mode, a minimax algorithm selects the computer's next move. The game logic and minimax algorithm are both tested using Jest.

**Feb 2021 Update:** I originally completed this project back in September of 2020. I decided to redo this project because I wanted to try implementing one player mode with the minimax algorithm.
